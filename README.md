# writing-final

This is the code for my final project in my College Writing 1 class
for the Fall 2023 semester. It includes three web pages: <br>
  A home page <br>
  A remix page <br>
  A global revision page <br>

Remix: Literacy narrative <br>
  Instead of writing about myeself, I will write about the solar system 
  and write more of a scientific web article rather than a self-centered
  essay. I will do into detail on how studying the topics provided 
  can change the way one thinks. These ways in which the reader might change 
  will be the references to my original literacy narrative.

Global Revision: Advertisement rhetorical analysis <br>
  I will be changing the genre of my ad rhetorical analysis from essay format 
  to web article format.
