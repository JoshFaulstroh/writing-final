        <h1 style="margin: 0">A Rhetorical Analysis of Burger King's "Moldy Whopper" Ad Campaign</h1>
        <h3 style="margin: 0">Joshua Faulstroh</h3> <br>
        <h2>Rhetorical Devices: What are They?</h2>
        <p>Rhetorical devices are a category of tools that authors and other media
            designers use to deliver a specific message to a target audience. In some cases, 
            those tools may result in a very successful message delivery and, in other cases, 
            those tools may also lead to the deterring or disinterest of an audience. 
            Anti-advertising is an advertising approach in which companies often use contradictory
            or oxymoronic content in an ad in order to exploit the effects of reverse psychology 
            on consumers. The companies that decide to take this marketing approach commonly use 
            distasteful, satirical, or delf-deprecating elements not only in an effort to increase 
            sales, but also to take advantage of a psychological effect known as reactance. An example 
            of psychological reactance is when an individual feels the urge to do something immediately 
            after being told not to. Scientifically, it is the brain’s reaction to a apparent threat to 
            an individual’s freedom of choice. 
        </p>
        <h2>The "Moldy Whopper" Ad Campaign</h2>
        <p>A particular Burger King advertisement campaign, first aired in 2020, is an example of 
            anti-advertising, where it uses distasteful imagery as well as blatant scientific points 
            to prove the main idea of the advertisement. During the 45-second clip, a timelapse of a 
            molding whopper can be seen, eventually ending on a screen which displays the words: 
            “The beauty of no artificial preservatives.”
        </p>
        <h2>Why Display Literal Garbage?</h2>
        <p>Determining the absolute main purpose of the advertisement can depend on the individual who 
            is watching and analyzing the ad. However, it can be concluded that there are three main 
            reasons as to why Burger King would show rotten product to an audience. The first reason 
            being to prove to the audience that BK does not use artificial preservatives of any kind. 
            The second being to persuade consumers that BK is a potentially healthier alternative compared 
            to other fast food chains. The third and final being to take a stab at other fast food 
            competitors. After doing extensive research on this ad campaign, there are also some additional 
            conclusions that can be drawn. While there are no artificial preservatives in Burger King’s 
            food anymore, that does not necessarily mean that there are no artificial ingredients 
            whatsoever. Additionally, the claim that there are no artificial preservatives in BK’s food 
            can also be seen as a facade to sway the decisions of those who are more focused on what foods 
            lack rather than what they contain.

        <h2>What are Artificial Preservatives?</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial preservatives are synthetic chemicals added to food products to increase shelf life. 
            They are used in numerous ways by a multitude of businesses. Commercial food manufacturers use 
            them to preserve the shelf life of many foods, just as fast food chains use preservatives to 
            prevent spoilage and maintain an overall satisfactory appearance of their food for customers to 
            see. These artificial ingredients that fast food companies use in their food can affect health 
            in several ways.
        </p>
        <h2>Burger King's Use & Ban of Artificial Preservatives</h2>
        <p>Burger King, until February of 2020, used some artificial ingredients such as sodium benzoate, 
            ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), and calcium propionate which, after the ad campaign 
            and Burger King’s commitment to do away with artificial preservatives, were replaced with lactic 
            acid, nothing, and cultured wheat flour respectively. The lack of preservatives in a whopper, 
            that would otherwise be prone to molding after a generally short period of time, would make it 
            easier for mold to grow and thrive on it. This is how Burger king made an effort to prove their 
            food was free of artificial preservatives, where they effectively turned these scientific facts 
            into a source of credibility in a society where an increasing number of people are looking for 
            safer an more natural ingredients. The simple intended purpose of the moldy whopper proving that 
            there are less harmful ingredients than there used to be is a way for Burger King to grasp the 
            more favorable side of the ethos surrounding the controversy of potentially harmful synthetic 
            ingredients in commercial foods. On the note that Burger King’s removal of artificial ingredients 
            in their food can make it relatively safer to eat, it should also be considered that the 
            replacements of those ingredients are very similar to their artificial counterparts. For example, 
            calcium propionate, which is the chemical that was replaced by cultured wheat flour in BK’s burger 
            buns, is the salt of the propionic acid that the bacteria in the cultured flour naturally produce. 
            This replacement makes little difference in terms of functionality, as both ingredients act almost 
            identically in food. The only difference being, one is natural and the other is not. A similar 
            instance can be observed in the meat industry, where celery salt, which includes naturally occurring 
            chemicals known as nitrates that act as a natural preservative, replaces artificially added nitrates. 
            This allows the company to claim that there is no added amount of a particular ingredient, except that 
            which is naturally occurring, such as the chemical produced by the bacteria in BK’s buns. While it is 
            true that Burger King has removed all artificial ingredients, or at least the 120 it has banned, it is 
            also true that the ingredients it has replaced those artificial additives with are nearly identical 
            in terms of function. The list of Burger King’s blacklisted ingredients can be seen as a limiter 
            on what the company can use in its food.

        <h2>Why Remove Artificial Ingredients?</h2>
        <p>The removal of artificial ingredients can either remove the risk of harm from consuming a particular food with 
            particular ingredients, or it can allow a company to slap a healthy label on the item they removed synthetic 
            ingredients from. Burger King could have very well had the latter in mind when formulating the Moldy Whopper 
            campaign. In BK’s case, removing the artificial stuff allows them to market their food products in a way that 
            makes them seem drastically healthier. The brief words associated with the campaign, “The Beauty of No 
            Artificial Preservatives,” sort of emphasizes the idea that Burger king’s food is now healthier than ever. 
            In those six words, there are two main selling points. The first being the fact that there are no artificial 
            preservatives and the second being the redefining of beauty as the reality that stems from the first. At the 
            end of the day, however, they are marketing towards those who may be looking for healthier alternatives when 
            it comes to fast food, such as those on lunch break and want a convenient snack or meal.
        </p>
        <h2>Word Bias: A Helful Tool in Marketing</h2>
        <p>In presenting such few words in the advertisements, BK also took advantage of wording bias. Wording bias is 
            seen virtually everywhere in present times. Even products at stores and survey questions take advantage of 
            wording bias to get people to buy a specific product or respond a certain way. For example, the percentage of 
            fat in milk. Some gallons of milk may display that they are 98% fat free, while others display that they have 
            2% fat. Many may have heard of the situation where a glass can either be seen as half full, rather than half 
            empty. “The beauty of no artificial preservatives” is the reality that there are nearly identical ingredients 
            included; however, the sentence that BK used can appeal to those who care more about what a food lacks, rather 
            than what it contains.
        </p>
        <h2>Graphics & Music</h2>
        <p>Some additional methods that BK used to deliver their message were through the graphics and music of the 
            advertisement. In terms of graphics, they displayed their flagship product against a black background, which 
            places all focus on what is on the whopper instead of background distractions, which are avoided effectively by 
            a solid black background that offers more contrast against the bright colors of the burger. Also, the song used 
            in the original ad resonated with the idea of the timelapse from the fact that the song title is “What Difference 
            a Day Makes” by Dinah Washington while the timelapse shows the day-by-day changes of the moldy burger.
        </p>
        <h2>Competition</h2>
        <p>The third reason why BK chose to display a moldy Whopper was to take a stab at other fast food chain competitors 
            who may have not been brave enough to show their own moldy food to their own customers. A sense of disgusted 
            admiration may be evoked because of this, which is why some members of the audience may be swayed into buying 
            Burger King’s product. It is not a common occurrence when a company tries to increase sales by showing its 
            consumers literal garbage so, when a certain part of an audience sees this brave effort made, it may spark a 
            sense of interest, not only because of the fact that a company is displaying rotten food, but the message 
            behind the rotten food. Other competitors to BK, namely McDonalds, have been known to have food items that sat 
            in customers’ cars and houses for months, years even, without rotting or showing any signs of decomposition 
            whatsoever. The viewers of the moldy whopper ads that know this fact may be even more swayed, in the fact that 
            Burger King is proving that their food products are actually prone to the natural environment compared to the 
            instances where McDonalds’ quarter-pounders were as effective at keeping away mold as great as copper doorknobs 
            are at keeping away germs. 
        </p>
        <h2>In Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Taking a stab at competitors is a tactic companies use to get the general public to buy their product, as well 
            as other methods such as tweaking ingredient lists to make products seem like a healthier alternative as well 
            as outright proving that the company has done away with ingredients that are generally shunned by many people.
            Burger King has achieved these three things in a 45-second clip of their famous Whopper growing mold over a 
            span of 34 days. A lack of artificial preservatives, and ingredients entirely, can legitimately make a food 
            item healthier just as effectively as it can act as a mask to cover up naturally identical ingredients to 
            artificial counterparts. Additionally, when a company compares oneself to others as Burger king did, when it 
            compared the naturalness of its food composition to other fast food companies’, it could prove effective as a 
            marketing tactic to persuade consumers into buying for certain reasons, such as concerns about what goes into 
            food. In a world where people are steadily growing more concerned about how natural the ingredients are in 
            their food, Burger King has taken advantage of these concerns to strategically market in a way that makes 
            it seem like a very healthy alternative in a generally unhealthy industry.
